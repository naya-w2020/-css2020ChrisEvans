<h1> Why Chris Evans and I Should Get Married </h1>

<p> Chris Evans is the best. Not only is he extremely handsome, but he also the most kindhearted, funny, and romantic man ever. He was born on June 13, 1981 in Boston, MA. A gemini! Cancer and Gemini are compatable, therefore our love is written in the stars. He adopted a dog named Dodger who he loves very much, and I am also a dog person. Even though he likes the Patriots, I can accept that we both have flaws. He is close friends with Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, who are actors I also love. He is also very politcal and uses his platform to speak out against oppression ad injustice. He strugges with anxiety, like me, which makes our connection stronger. He has a brother named Scott who is gay. I am bi so the family would like me. He is also very successful and dedicated to his work. He also had the perfect laugh, it booms throughout the room, and spreads contagiously. He always makes me smile.  </p>
